<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Jo Langley, I'm a 57 year old professional working woman and I am going to change my career.  I
  'm looking for something more engaging and lucrative. The work I have been doing for the last 25 years has been a great teacher, 
  but now I find myself looking to make a change to something more satisfying, something that I can do that will 
  contribute to the wellbeing of others.</p>

<p>I love the prospect of working from home, or having the ability work travel and work.  Thats why I think coding and 
  programming, web development etc would be a great place to start. </p>

<p>One of my goals is to create an app for walking meditations.  This app will allow people to track their movements while 
  engaging them in ambient meditative tones, binaural beats and nature sounds.  I also want to develope a Diary app to make it easy 
  for people to journal but dictation, add photos, daily weather, and general notes.  This app will also have a health feature that can track 
  heart rates, steps, and other health metrics.</p>
